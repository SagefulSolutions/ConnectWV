1. Buy connectwv.com from https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/results/?domain=connectwv
2. Install wordpress or a CMS platform
3. Install a multi-store woocommerce set up
4. Create stores by county. 
    Maybe do this by creating woocommerce stores on lewis.connectwv.com, harrison.connectwv.com etc.
    Stores should first be used for local restaurants to take orders and get delivering instructions.

Figure out a theme for web site.
